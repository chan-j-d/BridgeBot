BridgeBot Repository

Immediate Tasks:

1. Daemonize the bot so that it is able to run it continuously
2. Build structure of the Bridge game (preferably as closely to a real game as possible for ease of testing and extension)
3. Understand more about Telegram bots. (what we want is likely a longpoll bot and definitely not a Telegram Game bot)

Task 1 (Daemonize bot):
can consider using Heroku to host our bot

Task 2 (Structure of game in Java code):
- how to construct a code replay of the game
- how do we want to create our class Dependency tree for this program

Task 3 (Telegram bots):
- Learn more about how to create fixed commands
- Learn how to get a bot to send a direct message to the player instead of in the group
