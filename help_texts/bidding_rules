Bidding Rules
1. The bidding phase commences if and only if all players have a hand with greater or equal to 4 points – aces are valued at 4, kings at 3, queens at 2 and jacks at 1; furthermore, 5 cards of the same suit are valued at 1, 6 at 2, and so on. If one or more players’ hands do not meet this requirement, then the cards are shuffled and redealt (known as a ‘wash’). (The bot ensures every play has 4 points or more)

2. Bids consist of two parts: a number and a suit. The number of the bid indicates, should the player win the bid, that they and their (currently undetermined) partner would have to win the number plus six tricks, whereas the other two players would have to win eight minus the bid number. The suit of the bid indicates the ‘trump’ (trumps are explained in the Playing section) suit (or lack thereof), and are ranked in the following ascending order: clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades, no trump. For instance, a winning bid of ‘2 hearts’ suggests that, with hearts as the trump, the winner of the bid and his/her partner would have to win 8 tricks, whereas the other two players would have to win 6.

3. Bidding starts with the player to the left of the dealer (in our version, the starting player is randomised), and continues in a clockwise fashion until three players pass consecutively. Succeeding bids must be higher than the preceding one (as explained in the hierarchy above). The winner of the bid must then choose a card that he/she does not have (this is known as the partner card); the player that has this card in their hand is then the partner of the winner of the bid. Only the player with the chosen card knows the partners right away.
