!MHow to start a game
1. Use the "/creategame@O_Bridge_Bot" command in a group chat to create an open game. BridgeBot will send a message in the group which will show the current players in the game.

2. For other practice game modes, instead use the command "/createpracticegame@O_Bridge_Bot". A message will show with three options. Click the option you are interested in to create a game of that mode.

3. Use the command "/joingame@O_Bridge_Bot" or click the button below the BridgeBot-creategame-message to join the game.

4. Once there are 4 players, the game will automatically start.

5. You can leave the game before it starts by using the "/leavegame@O_Bridge_Bot" command.
