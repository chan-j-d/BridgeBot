Floating bridge (also known as Singaporean bridge) is a trick-taking card game played between 4 people. The objective of the game is for a pair of players (known as ‘partners’ to each other) to take the necessary number of tricks; unlike contract bridge, partners are not determined by seating arrangement, but the bidding system. The game is split into two parts – bidding and playing.
